            <h1>Data Structures Visualization</h1>

            <p>Welcome to our data structures visualization website. Use the navigation bars above to view the different data structures, or see more information below.</br></p>

            <h2><a href="dblLinkedList.html">Doubly Linked List</a></h2>
            <p>Doubly Linked Lists define nodes that contain a previous pointer, a value, and a next pointer. At any given node, the pointers will access subsiding nodes in either direction. 
                <br><br>
                This makes a Doubly Linked List more flexible than a regular Linked List. At the cost of being slower to run and using up more memory, the Doubly Linked List is easy to reverse and has a low overhead. Some implementations include webpage navigation, programming a deck of cards, running thread schedulers among other uses.</p>

            <h2><a href="cirLinkedList.html">Circular Linked List</a></h2>
            <p>A Circular Linked List is a linked list which has no null value at the end. Instead, the last node points to the first node creating a circle or loop of nodes. 
                <br><br>
                This type of Linked List is easy to navigate since any node can act as the head. Due to its structure, it is ideally used for different cycles like resource allocation, turn-based video games, or circular buffers. 
                <br><br>
                However, it is diffcult to work with individual nodes as Circular Linked Lists are better suited for functioning as a whole. It also takes longer to sort or search through the Circular Linked List.</p>

            <h2><a href="dictionary.html">Dictionaries</a></h2>
            <p>Dictionaries are dynamic hashmaps that are made of different entries. Each entry is made from a key and a value. 
                <br><br>
                Keys are typically strings or integer data types for easy navigation while the matching values can be any data type. Keys within a dictionary are unique where if a duplicate key is found, the new value will override the old value. 
                <br><br>
                A dictionary will function as a Lookup Table where data can be referenced and edited by adding or removing keyvalue pairs and searching for existing values by its matching key. Data Dictionaries are created for easy data storage such as the Oak Ridge national Laboratory which provides basic information for different variables.</p>

            <h2><a href="oddEvenSort.html">Odd-Even Sort</a></h2>
            <p>An Odd-Even Sort is a variation of a Bubble Sort that utilizes the Divide & Conquer methodology. A given unsorted array becomes sorted within two phases, alternating between a Bubble Sort on the Odd indexes of the array followed the Even indexes. These iterations repeat until no more values can be swapped, indicating a completed sorted array. 
                <br><br>
                An Odd-Even Sort is ideal when working with larger amounts of data. Where a regular Bubble Sort excels in uniform usage, an Odd-Even Sort Often performs better in numbers. Often, multiple processors are set to run the algorithm in simultaneous instances (parallelism) to process these multitudes of data.</p>
